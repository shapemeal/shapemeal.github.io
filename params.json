{"name":"SHAPE Meal","tagline":"","body":"### Motivation\r\nThe main industrial sectors and consumer activities causing the global increment of greenhouse gas emissions are:\t\r\n\r\n* Transportation\t\r\n* Building and housing\r\n* Food\tproduction\r\n\t\r\nIt is possible to cut down transport and to build energy‐efficient houses buy how to feed the world’s growing population and simultaneously cut down emissions and reduce energy consumption in thefood system.\r\nThe food system operates through food chains and networks, from primary agricultural production through processing to\tretailing, wholesale and catering to consumption of particular food items served as ready meals. It has been estimated\tthat about one third of all greenhouse gas in the world is produced within the food system.\r\n\r\n### The Project\r\n\r\nThe SHAPE Meal project is part of a SHAPE – Shaping Markets for Sustainability, which is a research project on sustainability. The SHAPE project aims to analyze and develop methods by which companies are able to build up their own sustainable markets and simultaneously meet the challenges of market change to higher level of sustainability. The focus of the SHAPE Meal project is on meals served by catering companies in working places and universities. The project combines expertise from Aalto School of Arts, Aalto School of Science, MTT (food experts), and University of Helsinki (food chain researchers). \r\n\r\nThe SHAPE Meal project has the goal to communicate and promote a more sustainable and healthier consumption of food. The assumption is that if customers and restaurants are given information about the sustainability aspects of their food, they will make better meal choices, which makes big difference in a long run. \r\n\r\n### The Prototype\r\n\r\nOut of the solution concept, as the result of a joint effort between Aalto School of Arts, Aalto School of Science, MTT (food experts), and University of Helsinki (food chain researchers), and with the boost of a series of workshops and hackahthons, a SHAPE prototype was developed.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
